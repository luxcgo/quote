## Intro

Olive is a powerful engine which monitors streamers status and automatically records when they're online. Helps you catch every live stream.

## Feature

* Small
* Easy-to-use
* Efficient
* Extensible
* Customizable
* Cross-platform

## Installation

* build from source

    `go install github.com/go-olive/olive/src/cmd/olive@latest`

* download from [**releases**](https://github.com/go-olive/olive/releases)

## Quickstart

Get **olive** to work simply by passing the live url.

```sh
$ olive -u https://www.huya.com/518512
```

## Usage

Start **olive** by using config file, provide you more options.

template file to reference [config.toml](src/tmpl/config.toml)

```sh
$ olive -f /path/to/config.toml
```

### Minimal configuration

```toml
[[Shows]]
# platform name
Platform = "bilibili"
# room id
RoomID = "21852"
# streamer name
StreamerName = "old-tomato"
```

### Custom video file name

Add config `OutTmpl`

* Date: `{{ now | date \"2006-01-02 15-04-05\"}}`

* Streame Name: `{{ .StreamerName }}`

* Stream Title: `{{ .RoomName }}`

```toml
[[Shows]]
Platform = "bilibili"
RoomID = "21852"
StreamerName = "old-tomato"
# The file name will be `[2022-04-24 02-02-32][old-tomato][Hi!]`
OutTmpl = "[{{ now | date \"2006-01-02 15-04-05\"}}][{{ .StreamerName }}][{{ .RoomName }}]"
```

## Custom video save location

Add config `SaveDir`

```toml
[[Shows]]
Platform = "bilibili"
RoomID = "21852"
StreamerName = "old-tomato"
SaveDir = "/Users/luxcgo/Videos"
```

### Custom video downloader

Add config `Parser`

```toml
[[Shows]]
Platform = "bilibili"
RoomID = "21852"
StreamerName = "old-tomato"
# Use `ffmpeg` as video downloader
Parser = "ffmpeg"
```

reference table

| Parser     | Type        | Platform                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| streamlink | third-party | YouTube/Twitch            |
| yt-dlp     | third-party | YouTube                   |
| ffmpeg     | third-party | Other than YouTube/Twitch |
| Flv        | Native      | Other than YouTube/Twitch |

> You have to manually download the third-party `Parser` locally in order to use them.
>
> The deault `Parser` use `flv` which has already beed embedded into the olive , no need to download.

### Exec cmds after recording

Add config `Shows.PostCmds`, you can add a series of commands under any `[[Shows]]`.

The commands will be executed automatically when the live ends , and if any command fails to execute in the middle, it will exit early.

**olive** provides several out-of-box commands that have been implemented internally. (set config `Path` under `[[Shows.PostCmds]]`)

* `olivearchive`: Move the file to the archive folder under the current directory.
* `olivetrash`: Delete the file (unrecoverable).
* `olivebiliup`: If `UploadConfig` is configured, it will automatically upload to `bilibili` according to the configuration, if the upload fails it will execute `olivearchive`.
    * this requires to install [biliup-rs](https://github.com/ForgQi/biliup-rs) locally, and set `ExecPath` as the excutable filepath.
* `oliveshell`: split normal shell commands as an array of strings, and put them in config `Args` .
    * embed video file path as env variable. Can be used by `$FILE_PATH`

Config example:

```toml
[UploadConfig]
Enable = true
ExecPath = "/xxx/biliup"
Filepath = ""

[[Shows]]
Platform = "bilibili"
RoomID = "21852"
StreamerName = "test"
OutTmpl = "[test][{{ now | date \"2006-01-02 15-04-05\"}}].flv"
[[Shows.PostCmds]]
Path = "oliveshell"
Args = ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo $FILE_PATH"]
[[Shows.PostCmds]]
Path = "olivebiliup"
[[Shows.PostCmds]]
Path = "olivetrash"
```

Simulation:

1. Live ends.
2. Execute the custom command `/bin/sh -c "echo $FILE_PATH" `.
3. If the last command is executed successfully, execute the built-in command `olivebiliup `.
4. If the last command is executed successfully, execute the built-in command `olivetrash `.

### Split video files

When any of the following condition is met, **olive** will start a new file.

* maximum video duration: `Duration`
    * A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m".
    * Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
* maximum video filesize (byte): `Filesize`

```toml
[[Shows]]
Platform = "huya"
RoomID = "518512"
StreamerName = "250"
[Shows.SplitRule]
# 10 MB
FileSize = 10000000
# 1 minute
Duration = "1m"
[[Shows.PostCmds]]
Path = "oliveshell"
Args = ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo $FILE_PATH"]
```

## Supported platforms

| Platform |
| -------- |
| bilibili |
| douyin   |
| huya     |

**olive** relies on **[olivetv](https://github.com/go-olive/tv)** to support above sites. If yours is not on the list above, welcome to submit an issue or a pr at **[olivetv](https://github.com/go-olive/tv)**.
